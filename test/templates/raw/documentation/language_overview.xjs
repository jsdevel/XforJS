{namespace my.app.namespace}
#
#Template files begin with a namespace and end with a .xjs extension.
#
#If you instantiate the compiler with global=>true (default), then
#you can call window.my.app.namespace in a browser, or in the global scope
#of where your template is executed.
#
#Whitespace isn't allowed before a namespace declaration.  The idea is to enforce
#A coding style.


#This is a comment.  Comments in X borrow from shell scripting.

#You may use imports to combine other template files.
#More on this in another doc.
{import profile_sample.xjs}

#This is a global variable.
#Only templates within this file have access to it.
{var boo 5}

#Variables must be declared before they may be referenced.
#Now that we've declared 'boo', it can be referenced.
#
#References begin with the '@' symbol.
{var zoo @boo}

#Global variables allow the following expressions:
#numbers
{var coo    1}
{var cooo   0x4a09}
{var coooo  1.345}
{var coooo9 1.345e-1234}

#strings
{var doo    'string'}
{var dooo   "string"}

#null, and booleans
{var woo    null}
{var eooo   true}
{var eoooo  false}


#X allows most ecmascript operators to appear in expression statements.
#The following is a valid expression:
{var wooo 1 ||
      (typeof 2 === 'number' && ~~3 && !@woo) &&
      #comments ending with \n are
      #considered white space everywhere!!!
      (((('nested parens'||'not nested'))))#etc.
}


#You may define as many templates as you wish within a file.
#Templates are assigned to the namespace declared in their file.
{template wow}
